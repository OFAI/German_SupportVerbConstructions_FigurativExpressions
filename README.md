# German_SupportVerbConstructions_FigurativExpressions
This is a gold standard of 21796 German combinations of governing verb and prepositional phrase, represented by the preposition and head noun of the PP. The PP-verb pairs were manually annotated as lexical collocations or non-collocational. A distinction is made between two subtypes of lexical collocations, support-verb constructions (Funktionsverbgef√ºge) and figurative expressions.
